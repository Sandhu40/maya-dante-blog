The move from student to newly qualified social worker can feel huge. One day you are writing assignments and talking about theory; the next you are sitting at a desk with a work laptop, a case management system, and real families waiting to meet you.

My first week on the ASYE programme was full of mixed emotions: pride at finally qualifying, worry about getting things wrong, and tiredness from taking in so much information. In this post I want to share what that first week felt like, what helped me cope, and what I wish I had known in advance.

## Before day one: expectations and reality

Before I started, I imagined my first week would be mostly shadowing and observing. I thought I would quietly sit in the background while more experienced social workers did the real work.

Some of that happened, but there were also a few surprises:

- A lot of information very quickly
- Meeting many new people across the service
- Hearing about real cases from the first day

I realised quickly that it is normal to feel overwhelmed in the first week. It does not mean you are failing. It means the role is complex and you care about getting it right.

## The first few days in the team

My first days followed a similar pattern.

1. Introductions and induction  
   A tour of the building, basic health and safety information, and an overview of the team structure. I could not remember every name, but I noticed who felt approachable and supportive.

2. Systems and IT  
   Logging into the case management system, email, shared drives and e-learning. It was tiring but important, because these systems are how we record our work and communicate with others.

3. Shadowing visits and meetings  
   I observed home visits, child protection conferences and professionals meetings. My main role was to watch, listen and think about how experienced workers communicated with children, carers and other professionals.

By the end of the week, I had not done everything perfectly, but I had a much clearer picture of how the team worked and what would be expected of me over the next few months.

## Feelings in the first week

Emotionally, the first week of ASYE can be a rollercoaster. Some of the feelings that came up for me were:

- Relief that I was finally starting in a real role
- Anxiety about making mistakes or missing something important
- Imposter syndrome, especially when listening to experienced workers
- Hope that, with the right support, I would grow into the role

It helped to remember that everyone in the team had once been newly qualified, even if they now seemed very confident and experienced.

## What helped me cope

A few simple things made a big difference during that first week.

- Asking small, clear questions rather than pretending I understood everything  
- Writing things down during induction sessions and immediately after visits  
- Checking how to do tasks on the system instead of guessing  
- Making time after work to rest properly and switch off from the role  
- Talking honestly to my practice educator or manager about how I was feeling

I also tried to focus on progress, not perfection. Learning the role is a process, and it is okay not to know everything in week one.

## What I wish I had known before starting ASYE

Looking back, there are a few things I wish I had known earlier.

- Feeling overwhelmed in the first week is very common and usually settles with time  
- It is better to ask for support early than to struggle in silence  
- No one expects you to be a fully independent practitioner in your first few weeks  
- Reflection is part of the job, not an extra task to squeeze in at the end of the day

If you are about to start your own ASYE, it is okay to feel nervous. You do not have to be perfect. Focus on being open to learning, honest about what you need, and kind to yourself as you adjust.

## Final thoughts

The first week of ASYE is only the beginning of your journey as a social worker. You will not remember every policy or procedure straight away, but you will remember how supported you felt, how you treated the people you met, and how you spoke to yourself when things felt difficult.

My hope in sharing these reflections is that other students and newly qualified workers feel a little less alone and a little more prepared for their own first week in practice.
