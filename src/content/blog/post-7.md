Social work is often described as a relationship-based profession, but it is also now a very digital one. We record on electronic systems, attend online meetings, receive emails and messages all day, and sometimes even complete visits or reviews through video calls. Technology can help us work more efficiently, but it can also feel overwhelming and constant.

When I first started, I thought of digital tools as something separate from social work. Over time I realised they shape how we plan, communicate and record almost every piece of work. This post shares some reflections on using technology in practice.

## The benefits of digital tools in social work

There are many positive sides to using technology in day-to-day work.

- Easier access to information  
  Case notes, previous assessments, plans and contacts are usually in one place. This can make it faster to understand history and patterns.

- Quicker communication with professionals  
  Emails, secure messaging and online meeting platforms make it easier to speak with schools, health and other agencies, especially when diaries are busy.

- Flexibility and remote working  
  In some services, workers can complete recording from home or different offices. This can support a better balance when travel and home life are demanding.

- Online resources for children and families  
  Digital tools can provide information, support groups and resources that families might not access locally.

Used well, technology can reduce some practical barriers and free more time for thinking and relationship-building.

## The pressures that come with being always online

Alongside the benefits, there are challenges and pressures.

- Constant notifications  
  Emails, system alerts and messages can create a sense that you must respond immediately, even when you are trying to focus on direct work or recording.

- Feeling watched by the system  
  Electronic recording can sometimes feel like it exists more for performance monitoring than for supporting practice, especially when there are strict timeframes.

- Blurred boundaries between work and home  
  When laptops and phones are easily accessible, it can be tempting to check emails outside working hours, which makes it harder to properly switch off.

- Technical problems  
  Slow systems, lost connections and software issues can add to stress, especially when deadlines are tight or you are about to join an important meeting.

It is important to name these pressures rather than pretending they do not exist.

## Using technology in a child- and family-centred way

Digital tools should support our work with children and families, not replace it. Some helpful questions to ask yourself might be:

- Does this way of communicating work for the child or family, or only for the system?  
- Would a face-to-face conversation be better for this discussion, if possible?  
- How can I ensure that online meetings still allow space for reflection and relationship-building, not just information sharing?  
- Am I giving families clear information in writing when decisions are made, in language they can understand?

Sometimes a simple letter, a clear email or a carefully planned in-person meeting can be more effective than another rushed online call.

## Managing digital workload and expectations

It can be helpful to think actively about how you manage digital demands.

Ways of doing this might include:

- Setting small blocks of time to check and respond to emails, rather than constantly checking  
- Agreeing communication expectations with managers and colleagues, such as when you are available and how urgent matters should be flagged  
- Using task lists to turn digital messages into manageable actions  
- Noticing when you feel pulled to respond immediately and asking whether it can wait until a planned time

Supervision can be a space to talk about digital workload, not only about the content of cases.

## Digital skills and confidence

Workers come into social work with different levels of confidence around technology. Feeling unsure is not a sign of being a poor practitioner. Digital skills, like practice skills, can be learned.

Some steps that might help include:

- Asking for training or refreshers on key systems  
- Practising on test areas or dummy cases if your service provides them  
- Watching short guides or reading simple instructions for new tools  
- Pairing up with a colleague to learn from each other’s strengths

Asking for help early often saves time and stress later.

## Keeping ethics in mind with digital practice

Even when work happens on screens, our ethical duties remain the same.

This means:

- Respecting confidentiality when using email, messaging and video calls  
- Being careful about what we write in online spaces that may be visible to others  
- Remembering that children and families may one day read what we have recorded about them  
- Being honest with families about what is recorded, where and who can see it

The principles are the same as with paper records; the formats are just different.

## Final thoughts

Technology in social work is not going away. New tools and systems will keep appearing, sometimes faster than we can fully absorb them. There will always be a balance to strike between using digital tools to support practice and making sure they do not take over from human connection.

You do not have to be perfect with technology to be a good social worker. What matters is being willing to learn, asking for support when you need it, and keeping the child or adult at the centre of your decisions about how you communicate and record. Digital tools should be there to serve the work, not the other way round.
