Starting a first social work placement is a big step. Up to this point, most of the work has been lectures, reading and assignments. Placement is where theory meets real people, real homes and real situations. It can be exciting, but it can also feel overwhelming and confusing.

When I began my first placement, I expected to feel nervous, but I did not realise how much my confidence would go up and down in a single week. Some days I felt proud of myself, and other days I felt like I knew nothing. Looking back, there are several things I wish I had known earlier.

## Getting ready before you start

Before placement begins, it is easy to focus only on forms, checks and practical details. Those are important, but it also helps to prepare yourself mentally.

A few things that helped me were:

- Reading the placement handbook slowly and making notes of any questions
- Reminding myself that I am still a student and not expected to know everything
- Thinking about my values and why I chose social work in the first place
- Planning small routines to look after myself, like walks, meals and sleep

You do not have to have every policy memorised. You just need to be open to learning and willing to ask for help.

## The first week in the team

The first week can feel like information overload. New names, new systems, new procedures and new acronyms can all blur together. It is normal if you do not remember everything.

My first days looked something like this:

1. Meeting my practice educator and supervisor  
   We talked about learning needs, expectations and how often we would meet for supervision.

2. Induction to the office  
   A tour of the building, an overview of health and safety, and introductions to the wider team.

3. Systems and paperwork  
   Logging in to the case recording system, email, online training and local procedures.

4. Shadowing visits and meetings  
   Watching how social workers spoke with children, parents, carers and other professionals.

At the time it felt like a lot, but after a couple of weeks, the environment started to feel more familiar.

## Managing nerves and self-doubt

Almost every social work student I have met has felt some level of self-doubt in placement. It often shows up as thoughts like:

- Everyone else knows more than me
- I am not ready for real cases
- If I ask questions people will think I am not good enough

In reality, asking questions is a strength, not a weakness. It shows that you care about doing the right thing and that you want to learn. Most practice educators would much rather you ask than assume.

Simple things that helped me manage self-doubt included:

- Keeping a small notebook and writing down tasks, questions and reflections
- Talking honestly in supervision about what I was finding hard
- Celebrating small wins, like making a helpful phone call or completing a piece of recording
- Reminding myself that feeling nervous is normal when doing something new

## Building relationships in placement

Social work is built on relationships. This includes relationships with children and families, but also with colleagues and other professionals.

In placement, I tried to:

- Say hello to colleagues each day and learn names over time
- Offer simple help, such as printing documents or making a call when appropriate
- Listen carefully in team meetings, even when I did not feel confident enough to speak much
- Be polite and respectful with everyone, including administrative staff and reception

These small actions helped me feel more a part of the team and less like an outsider.

## Learning from observation and reflection

In the early weeks, most of my learning came from observing others and then reflecting afterwards. It helped to ask myself questions like:

- How did the worker introduce themselves and explain their role?
- What kind of questions did they ask the child or family?
- How did they manage difficult or emotional moments in the visit?
- What did I notice about body language, tone of voice and timing?

Writing a short reflection after visits or meetings, even a few lines, made it easier to link practice back to theory and values. It also gave me examples to use later in assignments and portfolios.

## Looking after yourself

Placement can be emotionally draining, especially when you hear difficult stories or witness distress. It is important to look after your own wellbeing as well as others.

Some simple self-care ideas include:

- Having a clear end to the workday where possible, and not checking emails all evening
- Talking to someone you trust about how you are feeling, without breaching confidentiality
- Using supervision to discuss emotional impact, not just tasks and deadlines
- Making time for things you enjoy outside of social work, such as hobbies, exercise or time with friends

You cannot pour from an empty cup. Taking care of yourself helps you to stay present and grounded for the people you support.

## Final thoughts

If you are about to start your first social work placement, it is completely normal to feel unsure. You are stepping into real practice for the first time, and that takes courage.

You do not have to be perfect. You do not have to know everything. You simply need to show up, be willing to learn, be honest about what you do not understand, and treat people with respect and compassion.

Placement is not just about proving yourself to others. It is also a chance to find your own social work identity, understand your strengths and limits, and begin to see how you want to practise in the future.
