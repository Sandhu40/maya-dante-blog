Social work days rarely run exactly as planned. Visits overrun, urgent calls come in, systems are slow and emotions can run high. Over time, I realised I could not control everything that happened in a day, but I could build small habits that made the work more manageable and helped me feel less scattered.

These habits are not complicated or perfect. They are simple, repeatable things that, over time, have helped me feel more organised and more able to think clearly, even when the day has been busy.

## 1. Starting the day with a short, realistic plan

At the beginning of the day, before opening emails properly, I try to spend a few minutes looking at my diary and to-do list.

I ask myself:

- What are the three most important things that really must happen today?  
- Which tasks can realistically wait until tomorrow or later in the week?  
- Where do I need thinking time, not just doing time?

I write down three key priorities on a sticky note or in a small notebook. This helps me feel less pulled in ten directions and more focused on what matters most for children and families.

## 2. Pausing briefly after visits and difficult conversations

It is tempting to rush from one visit or call straight into the next task, especially when deadlines are tight. But even a few minutes of pause can help.

After a visit or emotionally charged conversation, I try to:

- Sit quietly for a couple of minutes, even in the car or a quiet corner of the office  
- Note down key facts, feelings and any urgent actions  
- Ask myself what stood out, what I might need to follow up, and how I am feeling

These short pauses make later recording easier and help me avoid carrying unprocessed feelings into the next piece of work.

## 3. Writing clear, simple next steps

Large, vague tasks like catch up on recording or sort out that case can feel overwhelming and easy to avoid. I find it easier to break them down into small, concrete actions.

Instead of a general note, I might write:

- Call school to confirm what was agreed in the last meeting  
- Upload visit note and summarise main concerns and strengths  
- Email health visitor with key points from home visit and ask for update

Clear next steps make it much easier to pick work back up after interruptions, and it is more satisfying to tick them off.

## 4. Protecting small bits of time for reflection

Reflection can easily be pushed aside by urgent tasks, but without it, everything starts to blur together. I have found that short, regular reflection is better than waiting for a long stretch that never comes.

Some ideas that have helped me include:

- Using the last ten minutes of the day to jot down brief reflections on one or two cases  
- Bringing one focused reflection to supervision, rather than trying to cover everything  
- Noticing patterns in my responses, such as which situations leave me most drained or worried

Reflection does not have to be formal or perfectly written. It is mainly about giving yourself permission to think and feel, not just act.

## 5. Creating small boundaries between work and home

Social work can easily spill into evenings and weekends, especially when we are worried about children or feel behind on tasks. I have found that small, consistent boundaries help me stay in the job for the long term.

This might involve:

- Having a simple end-of-day routine, like closing all tabs, writing a short list for tomorrow and then shutting the laptop  
- Avoiding checking work emails outside agreed hours where possible  
- Doing something brief and grounding after work, such as a short walk, cup of tea or a few minutes of stretching

These small actions do not remove the pressures of the job, but they do help my mind and body understand that the working day has ended.

## Accepting that habits will not always be perfect

There are days when none of these habits happen in the way I would like. Emergencies come up, plans change and sometimes I simply do not have the energy. Instead of seeing this as failure, I try to notice it, be kind to myself, and return to the habits the next day.

Social work is demanding, and we cannot control everything. But we can build small, steady practices that support our thinking, our wellbeing and the quality of our work over time.

## Final thoughts

You do not need a perfect routine or a detailed system for these ideas to help. Even choosing one small habit and trying it regularly can make a difference. Over time, these little practices can help you feel less overwhelmed, more organised and more present with the children and families you work with.

If you are at the start of your social work journey, you might want to experiment and see which habits fit you best. There is no single right way. The aim is simply to find small, sustainable ways to look after yourself while doing a very demanding and important job.
