Supervision is a core part of social work, but it can easily become rushed or focused only on tasks and deadlines. When this happens, workers can leave supervision feeling just as stressed and unclear as when they arrived. When supervision is used well, it can be a safe space to slow down, think, reflect on risk and emotions, and plan next steps in a more grounded way.

When I first started, I sometimes went into supervision trying to prove I was coping. Over time, I realised that real supervision is not about performing. It is about being honest enough to say what is going well, what is worrying you, and where you need help.

## What supervision is for

Different organisations have slightly different expectations, but supervision often aims to:

- Support safe and effective decision making for children and families  
- Offer emotional support for the worker and space to process impact  
- Monitor workload, priorities and timescales  
- Link everyday practice back to values, theory and legal frameworks  
- Support professional development, learning and career goals

If supervision only covers one of these areas, something is missing. It should not be just about performance, or just about emotions, or just about tasks. A balanced space is more helpful.

## Preparing for supervision

Supervision usually feels more useful when you prepare, even in simple ways. This does not mean writing long reports; it can be very practical.

Some ideas for preparation include:

- Making a short list of children or families you need to discuss  
- Highlighting any cases where you feel stuck, worried or unsure about next steps  
- Noting any court deadlines, key visits or meetings coming up  
- Thinking about how recent work has affected you emotionally  
- Bringing questions about policy, law or procedures you are not clear about

You do not have to prepare perfectly. Even having a few bullet points written down can stop the session becoming a rushed update that misses what you really need.

## Being honest about risk and uncertainty

One of the hardest parts of social work is managing risk and uncertainty. It is tempting to present cases as more straightforward than they feel. Supervision is the place to be open about your doubts.

Helpful approaches might be:

- Saying clearly what you are worried about and why  
- Exploring what information is missing and how you could find it  
- Thinking through different possible outcomes and their impact on the child  
- Checking your thinking against thresholds, procedures and legal duties  
- Asking directly if you are unsure whether your plan is proportionate

Risk cannot be removed completely, but supervision can help you think about it more clearly and share responsibility with your manager instead of carrying it alone.

## Using supervision for emotional support

Social work involves hearing difficult stories and being alongside people in distress. Over time, this can build up if there is no safe place to talk about it. Supervision is one of those spaces.

This might involve:

- Naming when you feel overwhelmed, anxious, angry or numb about a case  
- Noticing patterns, for example certain types of cases that affect you more  
- Exploring how your personal experiences might be interacting with your work  
- Thinking about boundaries, work–life balance and signs of burnout  
- Discussing what support or adjustments might help you continue safely

Talking about emotions in supervision is not a sign of weakness. It is part of practicing safely and sustainably.

## Turning reflection into action

Good supervision does not end with a conversation. It should lead to clearer plans and actions that feel realistic.

At the end of the session, it can help to:

- Summarise the key decisions or agreements for each child or family  
- Clarify who will do what, and by when  
- Check whether there is anything you still feel uncertain about  
- Agree how progress will be reviewed next time  
- Note any learning goals or development needs that have emerged

You can also take a few minutes afterwards to write down your own reflections, not just the action points. This can be helpful for future learning and for building your confidence.

## When supervision does not feel helpful

Sometimes supervision does not feel as useful as it could. It may be rushed, frequently cancelled, or focused only on performance. This can be frustrating, especially when you are newly qualified or on ASYE.

Some gentle steps you might take include:

- Sharing, respectfully, what you find helpful in supervision and what you need more of  
- Asking for a written supervision agreement or revisiting the one you already have  
- Bringing a short agenda or list to help focus the time  
- Using other supports as well, such as peer reflection, group supervision or mentoring  
- Speaking to a practice educator, senior or union representative if you feel supervision is consistently unsafe or inadequate

Changing supervision culture takes time, but small, respectful conversations can sometimes make a difference.

## Final thoughts

Supervision is not a bonus extra in social work; it is a vital part of safe and reflective practice. It is a space where you can share risk, think about the emotional impact of the work, and plan realistic next steps with support.

You will not always leave supervision with every answer, but you should leave with a clearer sense of direction and the feeling that you are not carrying the work entirely on your own. Making the most of supervision is not just about what your manager does. It is also about how you prepare, what you bring, and how honest you allow yourself to be in that protected time.
