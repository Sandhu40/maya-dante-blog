Confidentiality is one of the first values we learn about in social work education. We are told that people should be able to trust us with personal information and that we must respect their privacy. At the same time, we have legal duties to share information when there are worries about harm, risk or crime. Good record-keeping sits in the middle of this tension, helping to show what we knew, when we knew it, and what we did.

When I moved from university into practice, I realised that confidentiality and recording are not just abstract ideas. They shape how we talk to families, how we write about them, and how we work with other agencies.

## What confidentiality means in practice

Confidentiality does not mean keeping everything secret. It means handling information carefully and sharing it only when it is lawful, necessary and proportionate.

In everyday work, this can include:

- Being clear with children and adults at the start about what can and cannot be kept private  
- Explaining that if there are concerns about serious harm, we may have to share information with other services  
- Avoiding unnecessary sharing of personal details in emails, open-plan offices or public spaces  
- Thinking carefully about who needs to know what, and why

It can feel uncomfortable to tell someone that their information might need to be shared, but being honest from the beginning helps to build more realistic trust.

## Talking to families about information sharing

Clear, understandable explanations about confidentiality and information sharing help to reduce confusion and anxiety. Many families have had negative experiences in the past where information was shared without explanation.

Some simple approaches are:

- Using plain language instead of legal or policy terms  
- Checking that people have understood by asking them to put it in their own words  
- Being open about when you plan to speak to other professionals and what you will say  
- Letting families know when information has been shared because of safety concerns, where it is safe to do so

It is not always possible to gain agreement before sharing information, especially where there is immediate risk, but it is important to respect people enough to explain decisions afterwards where you can.

## The purpose of good recording

Recording can feel like a task that takes time away from direct work, but it is central to accountability and safety. Good records show:

- What was seen, heard and reported  
- How risks and strengths were weighed up  
- What decisions were made and by whom  
- What actions were taken and what the outcomes were

In many cases, records will be read by other workers, managers, auditors and sometimes children and parents themselves. This makes the tone and content of recording very important.

## Principles for clear and respectful recording

Useful records are more than a list of events. They should be clear, balanced and respectful.

Some guiding principles include:

- Writing in a way that you would be comfortable for the child or parent to read later  
- Being factual and specific, avoiding labels and assumptions  
- Separating what you observed from what was reported by others and your professional opinion  
- Including both strengths and worries, not only problems  
- Recording decisions and the reasons behind them, not just actions

Taking a moment to read back what you have written, imagining the family reading it, can be a simple but powerful check.

## Sharing information with other professionals

Multi-agency working requires regular sharing of information. The challenge is to share enough to protect children and support families, without sharing more than is necessary.

When sharing information, it can help to:

- Check local policies and national guidance on information sharing  
- Share information that is relevant to the purpose of the discussion or meeting  
- Use secure channels where possible, especially for sensitive details  
- Record what was shared, with whom and why  
- Note any agreements or plans that follow from the discussion

If you are unsure whether to share information, discussing it with a manager in supervision or a brief consultation can provide guidance and shared responsibility.

## Managing digital information and security

Much social work information is now stored and shared digitally. This brings extra responsibilities.

Everyday good practice might include:

- Locking screens when away from your desk  
- Being careful with printed documents, notebooks and memory sticks  
- Avoiding case discussions in public places or on unsecured devices  
- Following local rules about email, messaging and remote working  
- Reporting any data breaches or losses quickly, so that action can be taken

These habits help to protect children, families and workers, and to maintain trust in the service.

## Reflecting on your own practice

Confidentiality and record-keeping can become automatic, especially when you are busy. It can be useful to pause and reflect from time to time.

Questions you might ask yourself include:

- Would the person or family feel fairly represented if they read my recording?  
- Have I clearly explained confidentiality and information sharing to this family?  
- Am I sharing information in a way that is necessary, lawful and proportionate?  
- Do my records show my reasoning, not just my actions?  
- What might I want to do differently in future?

These reflections can be brought into supervision, where you can explore dilemmas and learning needs in a supportive space.

## Final thoughts

Confidentiality and recording are not just administrative tasks in social work. They are practical expressions of our values and responsibilities. They influence how safe children are, how respected families feel, and how clearly our decisions can be understood and reviewed.

By aiming for honest conversations about information sharing, careful and respectful records, and thoughtful multi-agency communication, we can support safer and more transparent practice for everyone involved.
