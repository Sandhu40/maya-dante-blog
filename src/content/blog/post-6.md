title: "How My Understanding of Social Work Has Changed Over Time"
excerpt: "When I first heard the words social work, I had a very simple picture in my mind. Over time, through university, placement and ASYE, that picture has changed again and again. In this post I share how my understanding of social work has evolved, and what I have learned along the way."

Most of us start social work with an idea in our heads of what the job will be like. Sometimes that idea comes from our own life, sometimes from news, TV or conversations with other people. As we move through university, placements and into practice, that idea changes. Some parts are better than we expected, some are harder, and some are simply different.

Looking back, my understanding of social work has gone through several stages, a bit like moving through different chapters of the same book.

## Before university: a simple picture

Before I started studying, I thought social workers were mainly involved when children were at serious risk. I imagined court, removal, and constant crisis. I also saw social workers as very strong people who always knew exactly what to do.

My view was shaped by stories from friends, news reports and community conversations. I did not yet see all the quieter parts of the role, like listening, advocating, supporting change over time and working with networks.

## During university: theory and first layers of learning

At university, my picture widened. I began to see social work as:

- A values-based profession rooted in human rights, dignity and social justice  
- Work that happens across many settings, not only child protection  
- A role that involves systems, law, policy and community, not just individuals

We learned about theories, legislation and models of practice. At times it felt very abstract. I remember wondering how much of it I would actually use. Only later did I realise how often I would draw on those ideas, even if I did not name them out loud.

## First placement: seeing real lives behind the theory

My first placement was the first time I truly saw how complex real life can be. Families did not fit neatly into textbook categories. People could be both loving and struggling, both protective and overwhelmed.

In that stage, my understanding shifted again:

- I saw how important practical support was alongside emotional support  
- I noticed how poverty, housing and wider systems affected what families could do  
- I realised how much time social workers spend coordinating, recording and negotiating with other services

It became clear that social work is not just about individual change. It is also about working with the environment people live in, with all its limitations and pressures.

## Final placement and ASYE: holding risk and uncertainty

In my later placement and then ASYE, I started to hold more responsibility. This was another big shift. It was no longer enough to simply observe; I had to make and defend decisions.

At this point, I learned that:

- Risk is rarely black and white. There are often grey areas and unanswered questions.  
- Good decisions are usually shared decisions, made through supervision and multi-agency discussion.  
- It is possible to feel both confident and anxious at the same time, and that is normal.

My understanding of social work became less about having the right answer and more about having a thoughtful process, being open about uncertainty and keeping the child at the centre.

## The emotional side of the work

One of the biggest areas of change has been how I view the emotional side of the role. At first, I thought I had to stay calm and unaffected to be professional. Over time, I realised that:

- It is normal to feel moved, upset, worried or tired by this work  
- Being affected does not mean you are unprofessional; it means you are human  
- The key is not to shut off your feelings, but to notice them, talk about them and use support

Supervision, reflective spaces and peer support have become essential parts of how I manage the emotional impact of practice.

## What has stayed the same

Even though my understanding has changed, some things have stayed constant.

- The belief that children and families deserve to be listened to and treated with respect  
- The wish to make some kind of positive difference, even if it is small  
- The feeling that social work is challenging, but also meaningful and important

These core motivations have helped me through the times when the system has felt heavy or progress has been slow.

## What I believe social work is now

Today, I see social work as:

- A balancing act between care and control, support and challenge  
- A mix of relationship-based work, legal duties and practical problem solving  
- A team effort that relies on good communication, supervision and multi-agency working  
- A long journey of learning, where no one is ever fully finished or perfect

It is not the simple picture I had at the start, but it is more real, and in many ways more hopeful. Social work is full of difficulty, but also full of quiet acts of care, advocacy and persistence that are not always visible from the outside.

## Final thoughts

If you are at the beginning of your own social work journey, it is okay if your understanding feels unclear or if it keeps changing. That is part of learning. You do not need to have a fixed definition of social work right now.

What matters is staying curious, being willing to reflect, and allowing your views to grow as you meet more people and see more of the work. Over time, you will form your own understanding of what social work means, and how you want to practise within it.
